Because of the obvious mix up in the kitchen with orders, I can hypothetically conclude my sandwich had sat around for quite a while and done laps in and out of chef microwaves nuclear hands, repeatedly crucified beyond human consumption. I'm one of those people who will sit with their tail between their legs in defeat and when asked 'hows my food' I'll meekly reply 'fine', but this sandwich was so incredible tough, it was like trying to chew a rubber chicken dog toy.  It was a health hazard to your teeth and gums, that I pushed it aside and got up to leave. My partner sensed I was unhappy and quickly offered to swap her quesadilla with me as it was my birthday, but when she tried tackling her first bite of the \"freshly prepared sandwich to order\", she quietly passed on the second bite. She proceeded to open the sandwich to salvage some of the warm chicken filling inside, but gave up the task of sifting through gristle and cartilage to find her lunch too daunting, and pushed it aside, defeated.", "Now what to do.

Wijayapala acted like he owned the place which although I must admit was initially charming, became quite when he said I should finish the last few strands of kankun and actually shoveled them into my plate himself. This was after he had brought the overcooked seafood fried rice 15 minutes before the pepper cuttlefish, which itself arrived 10 minutes before the soggy chilli pork which, if you believe it, came 10 minutes before the meh kankun dish.

It's an absolute disappointment. They took one hour to bring the fried rice and by that time all the other food got cold. We ordered another portion of fried rice and that took another 30 mins. I don't know what the reviewer means by saying the service is good. And if you seriously means the food is tasty, probably it means you have not gone to any other restaurant in your whole life. And I don't know whether it was just our luck but the waiter was very moody.", "So we come here for office lunches all the time and it's very quick and good quality. HOWEVER we got take out one night, and it took 1 hour 15 minutes. We could have eaten a 3 course meal there in that time. Also the chili pork was a massive portion of bland yet insanely spicy curry with boiled pork floating in it - AND they'd slopped it into an actual plastic bag, handles and all. Apart from the prawn fried rice, everything else was honestly awful.", "Will stick to office lunch when Imaad is there to flirt with Wijaypala.", "The food here used to be the best. My wife was in China for over 5 years and according to her Min Han has very authentic Chinese food. This is the best place in Colombo for real Chinese food. We are regulars here and in recent days we have noticed that the quality of the food has little deteriorated.

We had ordered lime juice without sugar, and they messed up this simple order twice. Once they brought the lime juice made with Sprite. Then they brought it with sugar, and on the third go they brought us the right one. The waiter was unapologetic and looked annoyed each time we politely told him. When the food was being laid out, another waiter knocked a cup of green and spilled it all over one of the guests. Again, no apology. Only a glum expression. We had to ask for plates once the food was brought!  Although we had been polite through the bad service in order not to spoil the dinner, the waiters did not smile or wish us goodbye when we left.

Still kinda disappointed with BK.", "To be honest, Burger King do not meet the customer expectorations. We pay price and the quality is zero, I can recall my memory on the start-up days of BK - SL and still I dont think we eat burgers @ BK-SL, Plus just like other franchised partners just as they do, BK-SL has forgotten  the business that they entered, Saw \"King Rice\" product and feel \"Sri Lankan Buriyani transition Hurricane\" already blow BK-SL also.

Sadly, you are under stress by all three factors. Otherwise, you would not have certainly shown the kind of spirit displayed in your biased review, as well suggested by Lalith. Like the few others who have commented about your review, I am one of those who has visited Namaste four times already, both for lunch and dinner, three times with my family and friends, purely to give them a wonderful Biriyani feed plus other varieties of typical Indian stuff. A few of my friends had come a couple of times more, to carry takeaways of Biriyani for their colleagues. Such is the taste of the pudding. As one drop of rain water does not make an ocean, just one prejudiced comment will hardly harm the prestige, Namaste seems to have already earned in less than two months.

Even though it took 30 to deliver my order their staff is very polite, specially person who handles the valley parking is very helpful. Namaste biriyani is original indian biriyani and not muslim biriyani like Top form or Big bite.

Welcome was good, orders were taken quickly and food was served\u2026 however the problem started on the rice portions\u2026 rice was brought in two bowls however the portion was very little\u2026 there were never 7 portions of rice (in the two bowls) equal, if we had individually ordered\u2026 piece of chicken was good but fish and cuttlefish portions were not impressive\u2026 NOT the best place to go with a lot of guys, even if you do make sure to order individual portions \u2026", "3 years ago,  I was mislead by a YAMU review which led me to visit this place.

To be halaal certified the place in question has to submit a request/invitation to the relevant authorities. The authorities do not go around asking or demanding places be halaal certified. This seems to be a common misconception. Another condition regarding the attainment of the halaal certificate is that none of the branches of the franchise in question should serve or use non-permitted ingredients. An example of this would be Bread Talk. Although their Park Street branch does not use pork they still won't be able to get the certificate simply due to the fact that their other branches do.

Loved everything about this place !", "Dao Krua Thai turned out to be a pleasant surprise, as it was exactly what it claimed to be \u2013 a small eatery selling \u201cauthentic Thai street-food\u201d cooked by a homely middle-aged Thai lady named Dao. The ambience is minus all the frills and finery you would expect to find in any other foreign cuisine restaurant in Sri Lanka, but is brightly lit up in vibrant colours and white lights with Spartan (yet functional) furniture. It also does not have air-conditioning, which means it is one place you could enjoy unpretentious Thai food and leave without smelling delicious. It really does remind you of the small bustling eateries you would find at a marketplace in Bangkok.", "This was a refreshing change from the various small cafes and stalls at almost every (so called) \u201cfood festival\u201d, that CLAIMS to serve \u201cstreet food\u201d. The experience at Dao Krua Thai is the real deal, and you get what you came for.", "When one hears the words \u2018Thai food\u2019, what usually pops into one\u2019s head are tom yum soup, phad thai, rich coconut-milk infused curry, intense flavours, followed by levels of heat that clears one\u2019s sinuses.", "Therefore, we started off with a tom yum soup. The portion size of the soup looks deceptively small when it arrives (within 10 minutes or so); but if ordered as an appetiser this one portion is more than enough for two people. As per the review, we were prepared for \u2018a lemongrass-y bullet down the throat that cleansed nasal cavities of the flu and all other evils\u2019.", "The reality, however, was that the soup was packed with flavours, and in my opinion, had the right balance of umami in the broth, sweetness from the basil and coriander, tartness from the kfir lime and lemongrass followed by just the right amount of residual heat of the chilli and galangal (ginger) at the back of one\u2019s throat, that didn\u2019t leave you gasping and crying by the time the spoon hits the bottom of the bowl. Each spoonful was loaded with so many bright flavours that even those that dislike soup, would certainly appreciate, if not swoon over it.", "Moving on to the mains, the chicken fried rice, from my point of view, was nothing exceptional and the portion size was rather disappointing. Even if the paying customers are not large eaters, this portion is definitely not enough for 02 people to share. For a portion such as what we got, the price tag of LKR 600/- is questionable. The issue here, is that the dish (albeit tasty) was unmemorable, and when the bill comes at the end, it leaves you with the feeling of \u201cwas that worth it!\u201d", "We also ordered the pork red curry, which was definitely flavoursome \u2013 but once again unremarkable when compared to the Thai red curries you would find in any other Thai restaurant in the country. The portion size was adequate for 02 people and I would not grudge its price tag of LKR 600/-, since it had enough slices of lean pork and wild eggplants swimming in rich coconut milk infused spicy red-curry.", "To enjoy the red curry, however, I would recommend a portion of the steamed rice (LKR 200/-). The flavours of the fried rice and the red curry just do NOT blend and is an assault of clashing flavours on one\u2019s palate.", "I have mixed feelings about the steamed dumplings that is available in pork and prawn. For LKR 580/- I expected slightly more than 4 small steamed dumplings. The dumpling dough alone has the correct texture of your average Chinese dumpling. On the first bite, the filling tastes quite bland and boring. However, couple it with the dipping sauce given on the side, and you end up with a mini-gastronomic orgasm on your taste buds. I would strongly recommend this, but wish they would add at least 2 more dumplings, since LKR 145/- per bite sized dumpling is pretty steep.", "What did catch my attention was the 02 (complimentary) condiments that came with the meal. The first was the standard chilli paste (homemade). The other was a thin dipping sauce that was a mix of fish sauce, kochchi chilli, garlic and lime juice. When one hears of the ingredients, it is difficult to paint a picture of what it would taste like. However, one teaspoon of it has so much flavour that it is not easy to immediately comprehend what it is.", "The saltiness of the fish sauce, the pungent smell and heat of the kochchi chilli and garlic, with the hint of acidity from the lime juice, just brings it all together beautifully. It tempts one to take leave of one\u2019s senses temporarily, and douse innocent plain rice with it. The result literally brought tears to my eyes\u2026and left me gasping for something to cool my tongue.", "Sadly, we were too full to try the sticky rice pudding and put it off for another time. However, we were offered a complimentary Thai dessert of sweet potato boiled in sugar and ginger, which was quite refreshing and light; and overall a pleasant palate cleanser.", "The service is friendly with 3 young local men waiting on the tables (which I think is overkill for an eatery of this capacity). However, they were attentive, the food came out fairly quickly and they cleared the tables equally fast. Hence, the turnaround time for tables seems to be quite fast based on what was observed.", "All in all, it was a pleasant meal and experience; and one that didn\u2019t break the bank. I would certainly go back for more, if at all to try out the rest of their small but practical menu, and would recommend it for anyone to try as well.", "The cherry on the top was the chef and owner \u2013 Dao - who comes up to your table to ask how the food was and even discusses how the dish was made if asked. She says all her produce is obtained fresh and locally rather than imported all the way from Thailand.", "Ambience \u2013 8/10 (as promised, its nothing fancy; just good food)", "Value for money \u2013 6.5/10 (portion sizes need to be adjusted for the current prices)", "PPP \u2013 LKR 1,000 - 1,500 net per person (excluding beerages)", "Food \u2013 7.5 - 8/10", "Hygiene \u2013 7/10", "Service \u2013 6.5/10", "Recommended \u2013 Yes", "I visited this place and tried two items on the menu;pork Dumplings and the Seafood Pad Thai. The portion size of the pork dumplings was disappointing and the seasoning was a bit bland and was also relatively pricey (4 dumplings for Rs. 580).The Seafood Padthai however, was really good but could have used a bit more seasoning and was also somewhat expensive at Rs. 750 for a casual street-food style casual dining experience.   I would go again and would recommend people try it.", "Instant favorite! Loved everything about this place. Definitely try the tom yum - It's probably my favorite. There was this chili paste that came with fried rice that was legit. The mango sticky rice was also excellent when I tried it.", "Two articles in a row where the Yamu writer mentions how poor or broke they are\u2026I get trying to be relatable but not the best look for Yamu!", "They might be sent on a strict budget. I Think its about time they come out and tell people they do Paid Advertising/Promoting.", "Hey there! The reason why I said that is because it's true! Also none of our food reviews are sponsored, we've been saying this forever but oh well.", "Thanks for the criticism though~", "Technically every food review is sponsored, because Yamu allows restaurants they've reviewed to advertise on their site. So unless these advertisements are free, every food review is being funded by restaurants you review. Which is a conflict of interest and pretty much a definitive example of sponsored reviews. This has never been answered by Yamu, and it's a pretty blatant lie when you say none of the reviews are sponsored. Particularly when the system was brought in place that only certain star reviews qualified for advertising\u2026 Then the star system was thrown aside!", "Don't treat readers like dummies.", "So jump off the high horse for one second while I look at the front page advertisement (at the time of writing this comment) for Kingsbury Grill. Which, surprise surprise, is a restaurant Yamu has given a positive review for.", "You seem to have some really heavy thoughts on this matter. I'm not going to fuel this little fire you've got going, but as far as I know I haven't accepted any free food that's been paid for by the restaurants.", "As for advertisements, I'm positive we charge separately for that although I really don't have to explain this to you, it's pretty basic.", "But yes, thank you for your time!", "Humour me and give an explanation, no matter how basic it may be - charging separately for advertisements is hardly an effective way of removing conflict of interest.", "Essentially, the restaurants Yamu reviews are also paying for Yamu to keep the lights on. That doesn't seem somewhat (even if it's not explicit) unbiased?", "Your technical definition may be true. The website and the YAMU company is doing a business and they need funds to maintain their office, the staff, the website, pay for all the food they eat and review etc. There\u2019s nothing wrong in that.", "Besides almost 99% of reviews are unbiased in the sense they are done anonymously. Very few reviews are thru invitations by the restaurants themselves in which case the writers clearly specify so.", "You can\u2019t fault YAMU for having restaurants as sponsors coz that\u2019s the most relevant target for this website! If the restaurant has had a positive review prior to their advertising then it\u2019s all fair and fine. You don\u2019t expect to see Bata/DSI slipper advertisements on a mainly food review website do you? Stop making a fool of yourself son.", "this was there in Battaramulla for at least 3 years near the chinese dragon at the Pellawatte junction.

Just wanted to let all those home bakers out there know that the list of cupcake vendors will not be growing anytime soon.  The Good Market is a curated event.  Prepared Foods is the most competitive category, and there are currently no vacancies for baked goods.  New applicants are welcome to join the waitlist, but priority is given to vendors that are \"good for the planet, good for the country, good for you.\"  Butter Boutique, for example, is committed to sustainable sourcing.  They try to purchase dairy, fruit, spices, and other ingredients directly from small-scale farmers and organic producers.  Stop by to learn more.", "Hmmm\u2026 as I remember, the cupcakes are quite expensive, at Rs. 200/- each. However, they style themselves as being \"gourmet\" cupcakes, and do have rather delectable fillings. Not sure if I would buy regularly, but certainly will consider for a special treat.", "why dont you do a comparison of cupcakes in colombo just like the way you did Maalupan & chocoloate milk.

I badly wanted to try it after reading the review here. Going to the good market mainly to try this I was actually v disappointed. The flavour is ok, but then again there was nothing special about it either.

Also the batches are not made in industrial batch freezers, they are made in small batches using small ice cream machines. So the texture won't be as perfect or as smooth as the large scale ice creams. We make the ice creams in small batches, it's all home made, nothing artificial !", "Has the rudness gone away now ?", "So we had a chocolate brownie, carrot cake and the lime and mint popsicles from the butter boutique\u2026 I love baking myself and just couldn't believe how amazing they tasted. Absolutely packed with flavour! The carrot cake was a perfectly spiced with the best crumb ive ever seen in a cake! The brownie was so sinful but worth it!!! Amd the popsicles were perfect for a hot day! Fresh and delicious!!! Cant wait to come back ans have all the other goodies!!!", "After seeing the raving reviews I decided to give a go to the Butter Boutique at the Good Market. The variety was refreshing and what I tried (carrot cake & the blueberry cheese cake ice cream) was ok but not worth the prices they are charging and the service! Dear God! Had to wait for a good 10 minutes until some attention was bestowed upon me (that too grudgingly) and was served by a very grumpy looking lady wearing a head band who ordered another to get me the piece of carrot cake that I asked for.

This totally confuses me. Isn't Butter Boutique owned by Sri Lankans? =/ Why do so many treat foreigners differently to locals? We spend as much as they do. We frequent your establishment as often they do. So why?", "I used to go quite often to the Good Market just for the cakes at Butter Boutique, but for the past few months, I find myself avoiding the stall & getting my sweet fix from else where.

There are so many good bakers out there, I don't see a reason why I need to go back purely because of terrible service.", "Agree. Although the cakes are nice, the owner is pretty rude.

From the moment we walked in she was loudly talking to whom I can only assume were friends of hers seated at the table directly next to ours. She didn't even acknowledge us at any point and certainly didn't seem to notice that, in such a small space, her loud conversation was very disruptive. We could barely hear ourselves talk because of it. This went on for a full HOUR. When that was finally over, she seated herself behind the counter and, only after several attempts to get her attention did she deign to look up from her phone\u2026and then promptly directed us to a different member of the staff who was already busy with another customer. No complaints about the rest of the staff though. They were very pleasant and prompt with service. Coffee is good. Cakes are overpriced and not even close to the best in town.

I'm not much into cake and nuts about coffee from the plethora of offerings in inner Melb.

Thanks YAMU!", "I went to Butter Boutique last december and was so tempted by all the beautifully laid out sweets. I had read about their cinnamon rolls so I wanted to try them out. Unfortunately for me they didn't accept Amex cards and I didn't have cash with me. I told the owner about my situation and said that as I lived close I will come back some other time. She barely knew me but she was urging me to take them and go. I declined many times but she was so sweet to tell me that I can pay her anytime. I was so impressed because the reviews did not do her justice. Here was someone who was kind and also very customer centric (something many people lack). I took the goods and quickly came back to pay her. Good indulgence!!! And a good host!", "I have absolutely no idea what the fuss is all about, from my very personal experience I can say that everyone at Butter Boutique is absolutely nice and serves their customers with a smile (and no, I don't know them personally, and they are still very nice). Of course they didn't offer me a kidney, but they still served me with a smile, and after all how much nice should they be when they are selling cake.", "We are going for their cakes, not to date them!

Conclusion, Street food are much better at their own street food joints. Not here. 850 for a hotdog means it should be exceptional. Stardogs hot dog is so much better and bigger with better flavor and value for money. Food wasnt hot, bun wasnt crispy,sausage was hard plus not even sauce is put.750 for hotbatter cuttlefish means its a proper dish. Not expecting some fried onions and leeks with few cuttlefish pieces which was not crispy at all. For 750 you can have the most amazing cuttle fish dish at sea food cove mount lavinia and the best of all is at arthurs pizza mount.For Bangers and mash, keels sausage is much better than sausage given here which was not done properly at all with 'not' mashed potatoes.

Sadly these owners decided to open it right down the road from the competition. Which brings me to think why they would do that ?

The food though was just not up to the expected standard. The chicken carbonara was nice, although they had deviated from the original recipe (garlic and turmeric in the sauce). The prawn jambalaya was plain awful. Watery, flavourless rice, tasteless prawns and even the baby corn seemed to have been sliced and added straight out of the tin because it was cold!

The private lounge upstairs is just a room tucked away in the unused part of the building, and once the waiters exit they apparently forget our existence there. We ordered 10 milkshakes and got 5 in about 20 minutes, and the other 5 in another half an hour. One of the drinks was in a different glass, because 'they ran out of glasses'!

As per my understanding, they were supposed to bring in the cake with the candles on it (the typical way it is done, minus the waiter singing happy birthday!). The guy brought the cake in its box and left it on the table, and left the room. My husband opened the box (which was sellotaped shut and exactly the same as it had been when he left it as the reception with instructions to bring it up all decked out), and the waiter reappeared, asking if he can place the candles and bring it back. So much for the big surprise!  A request for matches and the waiter vanished for a good half an hour, only to reappear after the cake had been cut and eaten. We asked for 10 dishes and sets of cutlery to serve the cake, only 8 appeared since \"that's all they have\".", "We received our food a good one hour after placing the order, and that was only half of us.

Was there for lunch recently and there was no one else there at 1.30 p.m. which made it all the more depressing. There was mold and mildew on the walls and the furniture looked tired and worn out. There was also a distinct musty smell as if the floor had been mopped with a dirty mop or the furniture had been wiped down with a dirty cloth and none of the lights were turned on despite it being quite dark and depressing looking inside due to the generally cloudy weather these days. The waiters tried their best to be accommodating but the overall place was a shambles. We ordered the nasi goreng and waffles. The waffles were alright but the nasi was awful. Mushy, severly lacking with the promised seafood  and overpowered with pepper. I can't recommend this cafe to anyone, not until they clean up their act and run this place a little more responsibly. It used to be quite alright in terms of food, service and ambience but not anymore and I would not risk holding any events here either.

The service was great - they recommended certain items, accommodated our birthday surprise request and were very friendly. The orders took a little time but we didn't mind as we ended up having a good time there.

As we walked in we were given one of the 2 round tables at the entrance. I had called earlier in the day to reserve and as we sat, the reserved sign was removed from the table. Above us, industrial fans spun at full speed making for a lot of noise. This was also disappointing my girlfriend as she had done her hair and the fans were just blowing like crazy. We were given 1 menu. So while once of us glanced at it, the other was twiddling their thumbs! Are you guys that short of menus that it is 1 menu per table? Not all table are ordering at the same time so you should have a decent amount of menus so whether a couple or a table of 10 sit down - everyone should have menus! We ordered drinks - their in-house special, green Lemonade and Orange - 1 bottle each. When the drinks arrived, they were so salty! I blame Kinita since she said they were so sweet in her review, the owners probably decided to throw a bunch of salt into the drinks :P Who drinks salty drinks with Mexican food? Mexican food has enough salt! Also add to the fact that the drinks weren't even chilled/cold. We couldn't ask for ice because they use these miniature milk bottles  so that there was no way ice could fit through the opening! If they are going to use cute bottles like this, then at least keep all the ingredients used for the drinks in a chilled place or better yet, invest in crushed ice and throw that in the bottle!", "We ordered a plate of beef nachos and the spicy chicken taco plate to share. The nachos took 40 minutes to arrive table side. My girlfriend questioned why such a simple dish would take so long to arrive? A staff member did arrive to apologise for the delay and said it would not be more than 10 minutes. When she arrived - she just addressed my girlfriend - as if I didn't exist! Since she didn't know who was eating what - the correct thing to do would have been to apologise to both of us - not one of us. The nachos didn't even arrive within the 10 minutes she stated - they actually took 17 minutes on top of the 20 minutes we had already been waiting! It would have been nice to provide some complimentary chips table side with some salsa dip. At least if people have something to wet their appetite then they could probably endure waiting for their meal a little longer! When the food came, the taste was fine although initially when this place was mentioned, people kept bringing up Taco Bell and I thought that was rather rude to mention a fast food restaurant in the same vein as this restaurant. However after the nachos arrived - similarities to Taco Bell ensured. The beef used is ground beef and not steak beef as should be with nachos served at a none fast food restaurant level. There was a generous amount of beef, but ground beef is quintessentially what Taco Bell and other fast food Mexican joints would serve. So it's sad to see ground beef being used instead of steak beef diced up. The nachos also lacked re-fried beans and jalapenos. The spicy chicken tacos were tasty and the salsa while it had the right flavour was way too watery. Salsa should be able to be scooped using chips, but every time we attempted to scoop, it just ran off the chip. The guacamole was also tasty. The mains were worth the money for quantity. We had to request for sliced lime pieces to squeeze over the food. How does a Mexican food joint not provide cut up limes with ALL dishes? Salt should also be provided table side - in keeping with the Mexican ethos.", "Even though the soft opening week had ended, it still felt as if they probably needed several more weeks to get things going more smoothly. It was hard to tell who worked there because everyone who worked there wore their own clothes! We wanted to stop people every now and then to ask stuff but weren't sure if they worked there or not. This place needs uniforms badly. All the staff (including owners) should wear a single colour t-shirt with the logo clearly on the front and back so we know who they are. The table next to us cleared and then a couple arrived, 10 minutes after they ordered their food, their nachos arrived, so service is very inconsistent. I went to use the bathroom only to find that there is a second larger section with air conditioning! This enraged my girlfriend because this whole time we were suffering with multiple industrial fans noisily above our heads when they had an air conditioned section all along. What's further upsetting was I called in advance to book a table, so at that point we should have been given the best table available (a table in the air conditioned area) or at least when we arrived - we should have been offered either the fan seating area or the air conditioned area - a choice that was never offered. The seating area right by the entrance is also very awkward. Just 2 small tables and then a lower waiting room style sofa + tables with people facing you. The front glass doors are also not tinted so people from outside can clearly see inside - offering no privacy. The pizza kitchen is right there with a clear door fridge and its contents facing the customers! We don't want to see what's inside the fridge when its just a mash of drinks and produce. The whole open kitchen area should be cordoned off better because it is barely used and really doesn't add to the ambiance - it isn't \"cool\". I also question why a place trying to make it as a Mexican restaurant feels the need to add pizza to the menu? That's like going to a Thai restaurant and seeing \"burger and fries\" on the menu. Stick to what you're about.", "My girlfriend spotted the catering menu and noticed that the images of tacos on that menu were blatantly taken from Taco Bell's menu! Here's a thing - if you don't want to be associated with Taco Bell - don't blatantly steal their images for your catering menu! Maybe hire a better printing company that doesn't lazily use Google images to make your menus! So overall with the excessive waiting times for the food and poor quality drinks, not to mention that the entrance seating area is probably the worst area to be in - while we were keen to try the churro cup for desert, my girlfriend didn't want to wait another 40 minutes for that. We decided to go elsewhere to satisfy our desert needs. We asked for the bill, but even that took more than 15 minutes to arrive after being requested several times! Too few people juggling too many things it seems. In the end the owner was nice enough to apologise and did make amends which i'm grateful for and I actually felt a little sorry given that it was a new business, but what was supposed to be a fun evening out, was honestly ruined. Overall the food was fair value for money but I still feel that Let's Taco still has a way to go. Food needs to be expedited better. Staff crisis handling needs to improve. Better quality drinks. Get rid of the fans and put A/C throughout the restaurant. Let's Taco is on the right track but someone needs to be steering this engine. I hope they can identify their problems and fix their issues, because I really want Let's Taco to work as Sri Lanka needs a good Mexican restaurant that isn't Taco Bell.", "Food was amazing!

A snack size was what came to us and for that price it just didn't add up.

We were a large party about 2 weeks ago and were hugely disappointed both by the food and the service, which at Rs 1850 per head (the most expensive in Colombo) is no value for money.  We also got the distinct feeling that the waiters would probably not have been as rude had we been a group of Westerners rather than Sri Lankans.  The tea is no longer buffet but in the form of a platter for two. While prettily done, the platter would never substitute for the substantial tea menus that are now common in quality hotels around Colombo. The 3 level platter is 2 plates of an assortment of many sweets and 1 plate of a small assortment of savories all of which was mostly average. But this this sort of arrangement is a rip off, because the customer has no choice but to eat what's given, with no replenishment. The overburdening of the sweets is an easy way for the hotel to get off without giving you a freshly made tea thus saving on staff time - sweets unlike savories can be outsourced and made days ahead. The scones came cold. The only saving grace of the already sparse savory platter was a little helping of smoked salmon. When some platters turned up without the salmon, the waiter actually had the gall to insinuate that we had eaten it and were lying get more.   For some bizarre reason, they serve you iced coffee to start, and tea is only provided IF you ask. No one actually came around to offer us anything, everything had to be asked for (including water) - repeatedly, producing surly looks from the staff. The tea opens at 4 but it took a solid 45 minutes before the food showed up despite the fact that advance reservations had been so they should have known the size of the party. The F and B manager was nowhere to be found to complain.  The only distinct advantage of this place is the view and ambience of the hotel itself since you can watch the sunset while you eat. But for this price you are better off ordering something substantial from the menu., or going elsewhere altogether for tea.", "Their Sunday buffet is overpriced (10k with taxes for 3) with minimal variety. Cinnamon Lakeside has about 4x more dishes for the same price. The desserts, although small in number, tasted pretty good. The service here is poor and appears disorganized. They don't include bread plates, dessert spoons when setting the tables - weird!, so we had to ask for knives, water several times. There were 5-6 hotel staff members dining there as well, I guess their priority is to serve their own staff rather than the paying customers.", "Go to Cinnamon Lakeside or Grand instead!!", "This is an awful place. Grossly overpriced, poor quality food, dilute drinks.  There weren't any side plates on the table, and the cutlery was kept wrong. Very poor service, almost non-existent service.

It was just maggi noodles in a broth with a boiled egg cut in half and a lot of leeks! U had to swim in it to find a piece of pork! I stopped at two spoonfuls coz why get fat over bull like this? I just wanted to get out of there! And once I complained to the waiter there were only 2 pieces of pork ( and when I mean two pieces of pork i mean two shredded tiny pieces of pork) he goes back to check if the dish is actually supposed to have pork and once he confirms it does he has the guts to tell me the dish only comes with two shredded pieces of pork. Really? You should have put that on the menu when I decided to buy this worthless dish of crap for 1890 rupees with an extra 1000 ruppee service charge!!!", "Nihonbashi is a rip off, they serve mediocore food and charge exorbitant prices"], "contact": "Call 0112323847", "address": "11 Galle Face Terrace, Colombo 3", "reviewer": "shru"}

Whilst most of you seem to be self proclaimed culinary experts, I would like to point out that chicken when cooked in low temperature over a long time tends to be moist and falls off the bone. Try cooking your chicken in a pressure cooker for similar effect. Also grass fed healthy chicken will have higher iron content in the bones and the meat surrounding the bone will have a slight pink tint to it.", "5.

If you are not in a situation to afford it, then perhaps just don\u2019t? Have a 30 rupee hopper today so in a year you can have a 200 rupee hopper at KS and not complain.", "6.

Those who do not deal with international environments may not know this, but Ministry of Crab is now known around the world as one of the \u201cmust try\u201d things to do in Sri Lanka. People are talking about MOC in every part of the world. People can go to Singapore to eat the best crab this part of the world but MOC still caused a stir with the experience they offer. You know who owns that? Dharshan freaking Munidasa!!! So clearly he is on a bigger mission to take SRI LANKAN cuisine to a global audience with the Kaema Sutra concept. And all we can do is bitch about is how expensive it is?  I would be so proud to someday see a hopper served at a Michelin star restaurant in New York by some celebrity chef. And for this to happen we need more places like KS and MOC (and Upali\u2019s and Raja Bojun etc) and more people like Dharshan. Seriously guys, it might be expensive, it might be different but for god sake stop putting down great ideas to have 15 seconds of online fame.

They have never mentioned that this was a professional review. There are no clearly defined parameters. This is just an overview of their personal experience, and the personal experience may depend on many dynamics of the given situation. They only provide an observation for you to go try and make up your own mind. They probably do have a commercial objective as it a business but they have also given very accurate or close enough reviews of places that would never pay money to advertise as well as give negative vibes for high end places with marketing budgets. Just because your experience does not match with Yamu, it does not meet that they are bribed for a positive review.", "@Suresh I don't think many of the people commenting here are doing so from assumption.

True that the price we pay isn't just for the food but for the atmosphere and service and everything else, but if people provide constructive criticism from personal experience, then any restaurant would do well to heed such advice and do better\u2026not be defensive. In testing out this cuisine which has been elevated to gourmet status and presented and priced as such, it's imperative that the restaurant does its best to master it.

The boneless chicken curry was filled with tiny bits of chicken dipped in watery gravy, I'm sure most of us here eat better curry than this at home, so you can imagine my disappointment. The mutton curry was okay but there was a serious lack of gravy", "The service felt very rushed and no one took the time to make any recommendations, They need to get their act together and treat their customer in a way that would make them want to return.

So we can assume that this was built for a niche Market (For people with loads of Money). But however even this niche Market should think twice before spending because an Egg Hopper with 2 Eggs will cost maximum of 28 Rupees (I know since I do own a small restaurant myself). And the rest (172 Rupees per Hopper) would be the price you pay for the Place + Profit. Definitely should ask ourselves whether it is Worth-it to pay that amount per hopper. It is the same with all their dishes.

The quality of the food was good and the quantity was sufficient ( the Hoppers and Rotis are large). The food was flavorful and not just chili hot. The cost came to Rs 1300 per head including all taxes, which is in the range of what one would expect to pay for a dine-out experience at a nice restaurant in Colombo today. Whether or not one wants to pay that for Sri Lankan food is a personal value judgement. We were happy with the experience.", "We've had three amazing dining experiences at Kaema Sutra over the last three weeks. The no-carb, no-guilt Kottu is simply fantastic. The egg white base substitutes so perfectly for the rotti that you don't even miss it . Kudos to the Chef for this contemporary twist on an all-time-favourite Sri Lankan dish. Another interesting version of an almost  'Sri Lankan Caesar salad' in the chicken curry salad which is a favourite of those I dined with. Again, it's a meal in itself and high-proten at that. As for the much-talked about roast chicken - it was so moist and flavoursome. And not deep-fried and unhealthy like most of the regular \"Sri Lankan roast chickens\". We liked it so much that we got it as a take-away thereafter; was so well-presented in its own bag/box (Perfect for when you're entertaining guests and you want to pass it off as your own creation!lol)", "On to more excellent dishes we've had there - the beef pickle is just insanely divine! We can't get enough of it. It's even a great accompaniment with drinks at the Kaema Sutra bar adjoining the restaurant. I must also commend the quality of the lunu miris which tastes so fresh and complements the hoppers perfectly. The hoppers are huge and glorious. The two-egg hopper is too good to resist. The seer fish curry and prawn curry are also favourites. Fresh, perfectly cut (the fish), huge (the prawns) and delicious. I must confess that I can't comment on the desserts as we've never made it that far, having over-indulged on the main course. Many thanks to the team at Kaema Sutra for serving contemporary Sri Lankan cuisine at its best. It's a refreshing change from the ordinary.

In fact I was disappointed that there wasn't anything I'd eaten already in terms of ingredients and certainly no detectable 'modern twist'.", "The prices were quite reasonable for what we had but I'd recommend staying away from the usual staples (dhal,  mutton/goat, polos, prawn etc) as they taste no different from any other well cooked rice and curry and sample the more unusual items.", "I hope they'll be a little more daring with the menu though - with such variety available throughout this land it seems that  Dharshan has played it safe\u2026 Perhaps that's just a temporary measure :)", "Well, I read many comments about the place, before I actually got a chance to visit it and try some of their food for real. Let me tell one thing, that is a place where they promote Sri Lankan food in a great ambiance. So, the pricing is fairly ok for a such an atmosphere. Remember, that is a great place to taste Sri Lankan food for foreigners. (Considering the amount of money they have to spend for such an experience in a country like this) But, I really doubt about these Sri Lankans who go there and appreciate their food for that money. For me, my mom cooks pretty darn well and may be my mouth is accustomed to that taste. So, I don't see any extraordinary fact in their Sri Lankan menu with the ones we prepare at home.", "I went there today to experience. ambiance is great.

In fact I prefer hoppers at Akasa Kade as I think they are much milky.", "Interestingly the Lunu Miris at Cafe on the Fifth costs Rs.125. Even more expensive than Kema Sutra. Also at most better than average Sri Lankan restaurants an egg hopper (with one egg) costs about Rs.80 (so the two egg version would be Rs.160 I guess) in which case this much maligned Rs.200 egg hopper and Rs.100 Lunu Miris doesn't sound too bad.", "Went there the other day, Jacqualine Fernandez was there too.

In a country where any thug, drug dealer or rapist could enter the parliament and participate in law making for the people the decent educated middle class is deprived of their innocent glass of beer or wine in many a restaurant in Colombo.

The service was atrocious to say the least. We very soon realized that the upstairs terrace meant we were in the \"forgotten zone\" of the restaurant. On multiple occasions, many members of the party had to go in search of waiters to take drinks and food orders. The floor manager himself attended to the drinks order and when it did arrive, it was 1hour late! To top it off , he managed to spill an entire contents of a sprite bottle on to our elderly aunt, who was drenched from head to toe. That was just at the drinks - Not at all impressed!!!! No dry towels (only wet!)  were at hand and staff seem to have disappeared soon after.  Following on we constantly had to remind them to serve us food as it was 915pm by the time it arrived. The food was excellent but what we just could not comprehend was why the place was at a shambles when it came to service. This was especially given the fact that they had prior warning (and a Rs 5000 deposit) of the party's arrival 2 days ahead. We previously hosted a party of 40 people for dinner at the same terrace in July 2015 and it was top class service to match the food served. So you would expect servicing 15 people to be a breeze.

The thin crust pizza had fresh ingredients but lacked taste. The penne pasta dish we also ordered could have been little more than the instant stuff mixed with a can of pureed tomatoes.  The salad was mediocre and you could fix something more interesting at home. Every dish could have done with more generous additions of everything from garlic to the herbs that one expects from italian dishes. Also: do not go there in your own car when there is any kind of activity from the SLTA - they own the car park where Santore is located but take no responsibility for ensuring there is any sense of order in how cars are parked (a security guard only stands at the gate) nor do they place any signs alerting drivers to this. When we left the restaurant we found that someone had parked in front of our car and we hung around for 45 mts in the parking lot until SLTA could find a way to get them out - apparently they have no system in place to prevent this from happening.  Another problem is that the restaurant is very small and gets very loud when more than 1 table is occupied.  This is worsened by the fact children and adults involved in the SLTA activities often walk into the restaurant just to get the benefit of the AC and so the restaurant itself never became comfortably cool. Perhaps the ambience is quieter at night when you can sit out, but the food was not worth it.", "what are the booze options like? can you bring your own?", "The service at this restaurant is a joke.", "On saturday, they had 2 waiters for the entire restaurant. By the time we ordered, they had run out of food.", "They have a lot of issues to work out before it's worth going.", "We had take away pizzas over the weekend and I must admit that the quality of the ingredients is very clear in the taste. Our pizzas (the four cheese with extra parma ham and the Diavola) were superb.", "The price was similar if not actually a little less than at Il Ponte where we used to go for a good four cheese pizza but the taste is far superior here. And the oven is indeed impressive. Very happy to have a relaxed new restaurant, where the emphasis is on quality of food rather than superficial gimmicks and fancy over the top design features. Will definitely be a regular here -- and subsequently also at Independence to work off all those extra Italian carbs. There were no parking issues when we were there.", "foodie, I agree with you. The Pizza lacked taste. There is no point using expensive Pasata for the pizza base. Concentrated MD tomato puree with garlic blended will work fine. To those who ate the Four Cheese Pizza the Gorgonzola Cheese is very strong and this will overcome the taste issues in the other areas. The Pizza could be rolled thinner how that my personal pref. Little fine tuning to be done and all in all can work out ot be a real nice spot to chill at. Good luck to you all.", "Had the biscuit pudding which was 690 plus taxes. Was the worst value for money we've ever had. The quantity of dessert was about two tablespoons and looked like someone had scooped it by hand and dumped it on the plate. Ruined the whole meal. The service was mediocre to say the least. Not one smile to be seen and the trouble we had trying to attract someone's attention it was like the place was self service. Won't be revisiting.", "Tried the pizza on two occasions and was disappointing both times.

The pizza is of the same quality of a top pizzeria in Italy. Sadly the pasta dishes were quite mediocre. Had a carbonara once and it was nothing special. I've had plenty of Antonio's mom's dishes there and they were all excellent. I wish he'd introduce them to the menu as well.", "The pizzas are a bit on the high side but they are enough for 2 people with moderate appetites so nothing to grumble about the prices. Along with Ming Han, this is my favorite place to go for a meal.", "We visited this place over the weekend for dinner and quite frankly we were astonished and gravely  disappointed. The walk to the restaurant from the car park felt very eerie and the restaurant was located right at the end with no lights along the pathway.  When we got there the interior comprised of a few wooden tables and chairs clumsily put together in a small space.  Overall not a good first impression but still decided to give it a try hoping the food would be mind blowing! I'd have to agree with foodie on a number of accounts. When there is more than one table occupied it gets really loud and the AC did not work so it was rather hot, overall it was very unpleasant. The sets of cutlery on the tables did not match and looked like something you brought from different houses just for that day! (and knives with plastic handles!!!) Now to the food, I had the penne pasta with chicken and as Foodie rightfully put it across it was just pasta and chunks of chicken mixed with garlic and what was probably MD canned tomatoes pureed! An utter disappointment! The Carbonara too was mediocre and nothing to write home about. Overall the food and ambiance turned out to be a bitter disappointment.  If the management of Santore Bistro Italiano are serious about this they should really up their game and provide good quality food and a suitable atmosphere to enjoy it.", "Tried the pizza diavlo. Absolutely superb! The best pizza in town!", "Tried it over the weekend for dinner, I thought the place was really nice, the pizzas were great too, however, couldn't stop but to feel as though they were being stingy on the toppings, fr the high price you pay, I think it would be reasonable to expect more than 2 pepperoni pieces per slice. Hope this improves because Colombo has missed having a traditional Italian pizza joint since Regina margarita closed down", "I dont want recommend here. Was disappointment at a lunch today.", "Santore is definitely one of the best dining experiences in Colombo. The location, being tucked away from the main road, gives the restaurant a beautiful sense of privacy. The candle/lantern lighting and music complete the calming ambiance.  The service is top-notch. I often find that servers in Sri Lanka have the tendency to linger, but the staff here are very well trained in fine dining. Not to mention that Antonio, the owner, was happy to introduce himself and check on our meals.", "As a table, we ordered two pizzas, two plates of pasta, and several appetizers. Everything was rich in flavour (I have no idea how earlier \"foodie\" reviews state that the pizza was lacking in taste). I was not surprised to later discover that all the ingredients are imported. Having travelled much of Italy and eaten many an Italian pizza, I can say that Santore epitomizes the elegance and taste of it's mother country.", "The prices are high in comparison to many eateries in Sri Lanka, yet are quite cheap in comparison to Italian restaurants in Italy, France, England, Canada, and the US. 1500 Rs. for a pizza equates to around $12 US/CAD, which is a very fair price, especially considering the importing of all the ingredients.", "All in all, I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who loves Italian food, fantastic service, and is willing to pay a fair price for the experience.

Both types were 1850/= on the menu. But when the bill came we are charged for 2100 + taxes. when we inquired, at first the \"hostess\" apologised saying the cashier has mixed up take way vs. dining-in and the balance will be given. After awhile the waiter comes and says, because we ordered half/half there is a \"surcharge\" of 350/=!!! my husband told him it should have been told at the time of ordering or stated in the menu. Then my friend checked her bill of previous day, to see she's been charged 480/= as a surcharge!!! this is cheating and misleading the customer.", "SSS, easy on the name-calling!

This was a real disappointment given that I had personally recommend the quality of Santore thin crusts to be likened to those served at the famous Wijeya beach.", "The disappointment didn't end there. The pasta which was supposed to be quite rich and creamy  did not have any such taste in it - it was at best plain buttered spaghetti loaded with pepper and chunks of cut ham. The fact that they forgot to add cheese from the looks and taste of it was just plain ridiculous (we all know cheese of any kind costs a lot in SL). As for the taste, think of Maggi noodles fried up on a pan (not the soup style) peppered up, and then add some cut cubes of ham in - this is what was served pretty much. Either every other carbonara I had tried in my life was incorrectly made or this one was so off base - it was this one!", "We will not order Santore again as it seems the ownership and management have succumbed to the food failure curve.  The quality of food was disgusting and at this price its uncalled for.", "If you take peoples money as a foreigner doing the business in SL you should at least have some standard you learned back in your home country about ethics and doing right by the customer. The rubbish you served indicates a total lack of respect for people who know good quality food and will not tolerate this farce. The fact that you don't have this standard Antonio means you should shut down.", "Went to Santore very recently and was very disappointed with the quality of the food - which is a shame because it has such a great ambience and brilliant service! We ordered the Bruschetta which came with Veg Tempura (weird combo i thought Rs 950) and both were soaking in oil.  Then we ordered the Diavola which again was soaking in oil and did not taste good nor authentic in any way. Wish they can get their act together again cos like I said its a great place with superb service which at the end of the night made us go home happy anyway\u2026", "I think quality has dramatically deteriorated from the last time we visited the place", "So Santore's put up heaps of advertisements, and even created an event for their Friday aperitivo, touting free tapas and 1 for 1 on cocktails/cosmos all night. Turned up at like 9 with a friend, and they denied all responsibility, even though we showed them their own FB ads. After about 25 minutes 3 waiters, each of whom gave us completely contradictory information, they gave us 4 pieces of  rusk with like Marmite  on top, and gave us 1 free cosmo \"as a favour\".

It must have been a bad luck to get an empty croissant, I never got any of those.  Further - a word \"panini\" comes from the italian word \"pane\" and that means - bread\u2026 Panini stands for \"small loaf of bread\" or a \"roll\"\u2026 Manuela and Samir are always there, and should be mentioned as \"the most hard working caffe owners\" - always kind and friendly.

But anyway went for what we came for, the Shrimp Fettuccine, Chicken Lasagna, and Spinach Ravioli, for drinks we ordered Iced Coffee and an Orange juice. Felt the orange was a mix of cordial, the coffee was good though. We got two of our three mains, at which time they said they'd ran out of lasagna. So had to go through the menu again and decided to go for the Fettuccine al Pollo with chicken.  This was the better of the three and surprisingly the Shrimp Fettuccine wasn't impressive at all. The Ravioli was good but not to die for. For deserts we ordered Tiramisu, Passion Moose, and another Iced coffee. The tiramisu tasted odd, as if aged, the passion was little pungent. Sadly the second coffee has more  forth than coffee. On the plus side, the waiter was great, enthusiastic & kind. We got some cookies, which I believe is given to dinners who put up a good bill. They were just okay. So to conclude, good experience, wanted something different to the usual Chinese, Kottu, Bugers, Subs and Thosais.

He kept hovering over us and making us give our order fast. To make matters worse the pasta I had was completely undercooked. When I asked him to send it back and get it cooked properly he rolled his eyes and swore at us in sinhala. Since we looked like foreigners he assumed we didn't understand. As I proceeded to ask him why he is using such foul language with us he had the audacity to ask me to leave if I wasn't happy. When I asked for the manager he told me he was in negambo and that he is in charge. This little boy who doesn't even look old enough to buy a beer says that to paying customers.

And the coffee being an Australian can compete with those in Melbourne. Coco is the only place in Colombo which gives Melbourne Cafes a run for their money. Overall great experience.", "I am a regular at the coco veranda! It's close by, has a good smoking area, the decor is robust and tasteful and the ambience is good. I get a lot of work done there and have quite a few meetings so tend to spend a good amount cash there. The food is really good, it's great value and is served in good time! The burgers, the English breakfast and the chicken great and veg with mash potato are top notch and as good as any of the same that I have had in expensive restaurants in the UK. The breakfast tea is always perfect for me too. A big down side is that the wifi and internet access is on a Tartuffe and runs out towards the end of the month, this has been 2 consecutive months now that the last week of the month has no wifi! You do notice that it is a lot quieter on these days! I take my own 4g router so get what I need. But they are loosing money by penny pinching g and not paying for extra Gigs for their customers. I have mentioned this to the staff and they seem embarrassed by the owners reluctance to facilitate the customers needs. The service is typical Sri Lankan! Need I saw more? I won't criticise the waiters as they are doing their best and are all a great group of individuals. But it's Sri Lanka and that means the service will be what it is. I have had a few issues here with my credit card being charged twice, got a refund, but the terminal requires replacing but again, the owners will see this as a spend and won't replace it. In typical Sri Lankan style, if their is an issue, the waiters and managers will make any complaint look like it's your fault, they NEVER take ownership of a problem and never admit it's their fault. Coco Veranda is particularly skilled in this Sri Lankan attribute. Conclusion, great place that is let down by the owners lack of investment into the wifi, electric points and plug sockets, a leak in the smoking area ceiling and an out of date payment terminal. A word of advice to the staff and manager, don't make a customer complaint a customers fault, take responsibility and act.", "Internet and wifi down again. The owners need to sort this out.

Peach smoothie tasted so foul, it did not even have a hint of peach taste. Berry berry smoothie was equally tasting foul but it at least had a foul berry after taste. Lime pie tasted more bitter and foul than sour, red velvet cake was too just sad to talk about.  A group of 9 people - we left more than 80% of food and drinks as it is just after the first bite, no exaggeration here.  Macchiato was terrible. even the watermelon juice was just watery. We were so stunned and disgusted to the point wasn't even sure where and how to complain about! It almost looked like we pissed of the chef and they were having revenge on us! But we were a bunch of calm and quiet people, I'm not sure how we could even piss anyone off. Basically this is the worst food experience I can remember in my life.

Both starters were left unfinished. Regardless, we ploughed though to the main courses (chicken and sea-bass). The sea-bass was good but small and lacking some rice or mash potato. The chicken was over-salted, I could only eat half of it. The deserts weren't too bad.

Not Fine-dining and certainly no Michelin star - I thought this place is completely over rated by you Yamu and a little disappointed as so far your recommendations have been pretty good.

We've heard mixed reviews coming in, we'll try it again", "a bit of preamble: my review seems overtly harsh, but that is cos the prices of dishes, fit out of the kitchen & dining space & MOST IMPORTANTLY the pedigree of the owners/chefs require a higher level of scrutiny than what I normally level at Sri Lankan restaurants. If one is pitching something to be on par with other great global eateries & with Yamu mentioning \"international quality fine dining restaurant\", \"Michelin star\", \"fine dining at its purest\" & \"isn't Michelin starred (yet)\", this places the establishment on a very high pedestal.", "Whoever does the marketing needs to step into the comments section here on Yamu & clarify any misinformation (is it a cafe, a bistro or a full on fine dining venue?).", "On to the food; after 4 visits over the space of 7 months, I am pretty unimpressed with the service here and also some of the dishes (50% were good, and the other half needed serious improvements). The breads really need to be improved, the mains also need re-jigging both in terms of flavour & cooking. Consistency visit to visit was an issue.", "Texture was a huge issue in a lot of the dishes. Either not enough (see tartare), or bad texture (dry or rubbery; breads dry, not enough texture in the tartare & rubbery ravioli, crab cakes & caramel flan).", "First visit was just after opening and it was pretty good, then with each visit I noticed a slip in standards both in terms of food & service (the wait staff are excellent, but they need a floor \"general\" to run the show since these kind of prices attract the fussiest of customers).", "positives: a few dishes had great flavours, all dishes had beautiful, thoughtful modern plating and brilliant ambience (I could sit here all day, it's serene, peaceful and decidely French).", "- bread basket with a lovely chicken p\u00e2t\u00e9 style spread (don't think it was pure pate, but chicken meat made into a paste. Or chicken liver & meat made into a paste together; it didn't have the gamey taste of liver). The spread really was BRILLIANT. However the bread was far too crusty & dry. Either it's par baked bread that's been twice baked or just plain old.", "- sea bass w/ chickpeas & bacon. a lovely dish, fish cooked brilliantly, not overcooked. I liked the combo of chickpeas with the bacon and moist fish and crispy fish skin.", "- tuna tartare pretty decent, but the acid wasn't enough. The chopped lettuce wasn't crisp (it was very limp). Also the quality of tuna was underwhelming. Also only one measly potato crisp for texture, more like a garnish than an element of the dish. More crisps please! or some Melba toast or thin crusty baguette slices. Texture when introduced in dish like tartare needs to be maintained.", "- Prawn & pea ravioli; lovely shellfish foam, pea pur\u00e9e goes well with the prawns, but the prawn meat filling was more akin to a gyoza or mantou in texture (rubbery). It had pieces of almost raw ginger in it. The ginger added a nice highlight, but should've been pur\u00e9ed or diced finer or cooked a bit before adding to the prawn mince filling. It was very overpowering.", "- crab cakes: rubbery texture and overfried. The dipping sauce/oil was thin in texture, so didn't stick to the cakes. Also the sauce was terribly un-exciting. This tapas style dish needs to be reworked.", "- pork cubes on a skewer (I have forgotten what the dish was called). This was too dry, a little stringy and not cooked very well.", "- caramel flan was too eggy in flavour, there was a rubbery texture to the flan (& also unusually the caramel layer on the top had a rubbery \"skin\"). I feel the custard had been overlooked and/or been in the fridge for too many days. Also served waaay too cold; straight out of the fridge, with moisture beading off the serving vessel's outside surface (visually very unappealing). The caramel sauce itself was good, perfect balance of bitter & sweet. The pistachio almond cake/biscuit that it came with also had the texture of being too old (it was soggy, but also hard/dense\u2026 like the humidity had screwed it because it had been out in the open for too long)", "- floating island / oeufs a la neige / ile flotant: Ive had this dish 3 times & it has been consistently fantastic (they must be whipping the meringues & poaching them to order). the slivered almonds add a great texture, the thinnish milk sauce works perfectly with the meringue. A really great dish, one of the best desserts in Colombo!", "- on 2 occasions I have had the chocolate fondant with a creme chantilly (fresh whipped cream sweetened with sugar & vanilla beans. Once it was overcooked & the fondant was too dense/hard in texture, the other time it was perfect. Accompanied by a reat chocolate sauce (not too sweet, nor too bitter/dark). Special mention to their vanilla beans; its not the crappy Sri Lankan variety, but tastes like the more sophisticated Madagascan or Tahitian variety (far more subtle flavour, and smaller vanilla seeds).", "- apple tart really good, multiple visits.", "- lemon meringue slice: great one time. But an utter disappointment the 2nd time (meringue tasted bad, the biscuit base was too hard and the lemon curd wasn't lemony enough)", "- some of the starters & veg dishes were quite good (eggs mimosa, pissaladiere tart). But the meat/fish mains were underwhelming. Their cooking of proteins is faultless, but more thought into flavour combinations & some overpowering flavours masking the proteins (meat/seafood).", "- a dining companion on one of my visits had the burger, I couldn't taste it, but had a nibble of his bread & the meat patty; meat was very good. But the bread was a touch stale (too crumbly & dry).", "- the tomato confit tart, had delicious tomatoes (pure tomato flavour and beautifully ripe, with the skins removed). But as pointed out by someone else; waaaaay too much cream cheese, and not enough texture (need more crunchy lettuce or more pastry base).", "For these prices, need to get their act together with customer service. Especially from the managers/head waiter. The more junior waiters have great backgrounds in working overseas in hospitality, but they haven't been fully trained up on the menu & customer service for the Sri Lankan market (it's vastly different to Dubai,the rest of the UAE, Maldives, Singapore).", "- greeting or goodbye (twice we got the greeting, twice we were ignored).", "- nobody actually asked us how our meal was during all 4 meals. Again, at these prices, this is important, especially for a new restaurant trying to make a mark in Colombo on the upper end of the dining spectrum.", "- the restaurant was empty (only 8 diners at 3 other tables), the manager never came up to me and enquired about my meal.", "- a French couple at the table next to me wanted to change some stuff in a dish, the waiter seemed confused, the manager should have stepped in (he was in the eyeline of the waiter so couldn't have missed the rather animated discussion which ended when the customer said he could talk to the chef in French and make him understand).", "So basically the service from the local waitstaff is good, they try hard, but they seemed a bit lost at times and didn't have a manager to step up to help them out when there were queries or issues with the food.", "Tuna tartare is one of my all time facourite dishes.", "There are a couple of people who might have invented it.", "One person (who actually doesn't claim invention, is Tachibe Shigefumi in the USA around 1984). Traditionally, in France, tartare was either beef or horse meat. The earliest mention of tuna tartare was in the mid 1970s at a restaurant in Paris. So it could be that Tachibe Shigefumi just popularised the dish and made it globally hip!", "Starter and main was good. Dessert was disappointing.

What owners of these restaurants should is that the customers are spending their money and time and it is a lot of effort to think where you want to get your food.

I'm not saying the food has to be at Michelin star levels but come on, at least taste decent. On NYE, we got to watch the chef smoking cigarettes outside the private dining area, while our food was being \"prepared\". Also, if you want to be considered a fine dining establishment, the waiters should be trained to be able to describe the food.

What they fall back on is the quality of produce which is a factor of being in Sri Lanka. However they make up for this with the blend of cooking techniques and bold use of Sri Lankan flavours. While their service doesn't match a Michelin start, it's still certainly the best i've encountered in Sri Lanka (Ministry of Crab has pretty great service too).
